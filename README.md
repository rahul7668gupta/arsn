Being a bachelor it's not easy to handle everything and one of the peculiar traits of human is to commit mistakes.
One day I was gearing up for my class,ironed my shirt,had breakfast,locked the door and kept the keys in my pocket.
On the way I realised that I had left all the lights and fans switched on.It could cause a menace but thanks to this amazing product(**OUR ARSN**),I just need to tap with my fingers and say **OKAY Google!** switch off the lights and electrical appliances. And guess what it's done!! The loss of energy that could have been said inevitable are now easy and can be done on the go.
